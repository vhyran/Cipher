## Theme Preview

This theme puts the focus squarely on your code. No distractions, no overly saturated colors that might look good in a preview but can strain your eyes after a long coding session. We have carefully adjusted the syntax and semantic highlighting across all supported languages to ensure your coding environment stays clean and easy to navigate.
