# Theme Preview

This theme puts the focus on your code, no distractions or overly saturated colors that might look good in a preview, but in reality, burns your eyes after a day of coding. We put extra effort in making sure your syntax and semantic highlighting are on par with your favorite coding languages. The Hack The Box theme is a constant work in progress, always looking to improve were we can. Share your thoughts over on [github](https://github.com/xarcgit/cipher/issues).
